# Hydra harness artwork

[`hydra.png`](hydra.png) is the original supplied transparent artwork. The product name is **Hydra harness**. DeepSeek remains the external provider name; upstream trademark guidance is retained in [BRAND_GUIDELINES.md](../../BRAND_GUIDELINES.md).

[`hydra-hover.gif`](hydra-hover.gif) is the supplied transparent animation. Hovering a product logo plays its 60 frames over two seconds; leaving restores the still image. Pointer hover explicitly requests playback even when the OS prefers reduced motion; leaving always stops it. Touch-only clients keep the still image. The generator preserves frame timing and transparency in a 128px animated WebP for the small UI marks. Native icons and attribution badges remain static.

Regenerate the client logo data, app/site favicons, website wordmark, desktop/browser icons, and attribution badge from this source:

```sh
uv run --with pillow python scripts/gen-brand-assets.py
```

The generator crops transparent padding and scales the supplied artwork without changing its colors. React consumers share `HydraLogo` through `@hydra/harness-client-ui-primitives`; its embedded PNG travels with every bundle. Electron packages publish their icon assets. Rebuild the apps and documentation site after regeneration.
