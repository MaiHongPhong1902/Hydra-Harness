# headless-agent

This directory owns the snapshot recording and replay composition for a headless coding agent: DeepSeek V4 + local bash and filesystem tools + subagent delegation + workflows and fresh-agent Ralph iteration + `todo_write` + JSONL persistence. It explicitly mounts the shared agent spine, one root agent, persistence, and checkpoint policy; it is not a second product entry point.

## Run it

```sh
# repo root .env (gitignored) or exported env:
#   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-…
#   DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://…   # optional; defaults to the public API
pnpm hydra --profile headless "fix the failing test in this workspace"
```

The product command is [`hydra --profile headless`](../../apps/cli/README.md): it accepts one nonblank task, creates and persists a fresh session, prints the final assistant text, and exits.

Snapshot suites run this directory's configuration through [`tests/fixtures/headless-driver.ts`](tests/fixtures/headless-driver.ts), an unexported test-only process that emits canonical session events as JSONL before its result record. That stream is test infrastructure, not a supported CLI output format. Child sessions surface only through parent tool events and results.

## E2B POC overlay

[`e2b.cordis.yml`](e2b.cordis.yml) replaces the local filesystem and subprocess providers with one shared E2B sandbox while retaining `@hydra/harness-bash-local` and the same model-facing tools. The overlay requires `E2B_API_KEY` when used against E2B. Automated tests use deterministic provider responses.

The overlay creates the same absolute cwd inside the sandbox, but it does not upload or mount the host workspace. File and Bash mutations exist only in E2B; Cordis, model calls, agent/session state, session logs, skills, and SDK buffers remain on the host. The composition kills its sandbox on timeout and disposal. It is a provider-composition POC, not a whole-harness migration or a workspace-sync feature.

## Advanced configuration

[`advanced.cordis.yml`](advanced.cordis.yml) adds Code Mode and the Cordis tools to the test composition.
